    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      My name is jake3143, and I am a student in ENGL 170 at Lindenwood University.
      This blog is part of a semester-long project where I explore writing,
      artificial intelligence, and intellectual work through regular blog posts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Throughout the semester, I will be using this space to reflect on course
      readings, respond to classmates’ posts, and connect ideas from class to
      examples outside the classroom. Each post represents an ongoing conversation
      about how AI tools affect writing, creativity, and learning.
