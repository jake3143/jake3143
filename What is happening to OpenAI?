## What is happening to OpenAI?

OpenAI is the company that has essentially been spearheading the development of AI throughout the world, most notably for their chatbot named “ChatGPT.” The company saw extremely high revenue growth during 2025, with a projected 20 billion dollars made in 2025. However, this year the company is projected to instead be spearheading the idea of having the record of “biggest revenue failure in history”, with a projected loss of 16 billion dollars in 2026, and even more in the years after unless they secure another method of revenue.

## Why is this happening?

It’s no secret that AI is incredibly expensive to not only make, but also train and maintain, especially since ChatGPT gets around 2 billion prompts worldwide every day. Not only that, but the company has expanded rapidly to the point where even the billions of dollars they make is cannibalized by the billions they have to spend keeping all their data centers up. In short, training ChatGPT, maintaining it, and hiring people to work on it is far too expensive to maintain for the company.

## How could this be fixed?

If ChatGPT keeps going on the same trend of growth without revenue to sustain it, it will easily either go bankrupt or be forced to be bought by a corporation such as Microsoft. And even though ChatGPT has subscriptions, gaining money on a platform that most people use for free is difficult, especially if they don’t have ads running on it. It’s also a question if revenue through ads will even be able to sustain the amount of loss ChatGPT is currently having, and a lot of people may just stop using it entirely if they start using ads.

Another potential option is forced subscription instead of optional subscription, such as needing 10 dollars a month to use ChatGPT in general, but once again, this would very easily cause a lot of people to stop using the platform entirely. They could also do the opposite, and instead of limiting the amount of people that use ChatGPT, they limit the amount of things it can do, such as preventing it from creating images or decreasing the word count allowed in a prompt. Once again though, this would undoubtedly cause a lot of people to either stop using it, or cause them to not use it as much.

Right now, there doesn’t seem to be an easy solution to this problem, which is going to spell doom for the company if they can’t figure something out. And if OpenAI fails, then all the features made such as ChatGPT and all the other things they’ve made will disappear as well. Some have suggested that the government may attempt to bail them out, but I don’t see this happening considering the scale of the amount of money they’re losing, and I don’t believe that our current president cares much about OpenAI anyway. However, even if they manage to find a way to fix their revenue issues, they still need to fix another incoming lawsuit by Elon Musk.

## Elon Musk is suing OpenAI for 134 billion dollars.

Or, more accurately, the leader of OpenAI. Elon Musk has played a massive role in the building of OpenAI. As a co-founder of the company, he gave millions of dollars to help OpenAI fund an organization that is non-profit and provides safe, open-source AI, which is what ChatGPT was made for. However, Elon Musk now argues that OpenAI has gone against the idea that he was betrayed and deceived into believing that OpenAI would be a non-profit open-source company, and that the company has stepped away from that promise.

If this lawsuit goes through and Elon Musk wins, it could very easily lead to massive shifts in the AI industry, and would further contribute to OpenAI’s already fast revenue loss, among other things. This would also impact companies that create AI/are helped by OpenAI as well.

## What’s next for the company?

Once again, the creator of ChatGPT has already talked about how they are planning to stop the loss of revenue for the company, but it’s still a question if this will be enough to stop the loss, or if it will cause people to stop using it as much. This isn’t a problem with an easy and perfect solution, and if ChatGPT goes bankrupt, it will heavily halt the growth of the AI industry. Whatever that will look like, we’ll have to see for ourselves. But for now, we’ll just have to see if the company will be able to pull anything to help themselves.
