## What Is Happening to :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}?

:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1} is the company that has essentially been spearheading the development of AI throughout the world, most notably for their chatbot named :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}. The company saw extremely high revenue growth during 2025, with a projected 20 billion dollars made in that year.

However, this year the company is projected to instead be spearheading the idea of having the record of the “biggest revenue failure in history,” with a projected loss of 16 billion dollars in 2026, and potentially even more in the years after unless they secure another method of revenue.

## Why Is This Happening?

It’s no secret that AI is incredibly expensive to not only make, but also to train and maintain—especially since ChatGPT gets around 2 billion prompts worldwide every day. On top of that, the company has expanded rapidly to the point where even the billions of dollars they make are effectively cannibalized by the billions they have to spend keeping all their data centers running.

In short, training ChatGPT, maintaining it, and hiring people to work on it is far too expensive to sustain under the company’s current revenue model.

## How Could This Be Fixed?

If ChatGPT keeps growing without enough revenue to sustain it, OpenAI could either go bankrupt or be forced to be bought by a corporation such as :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}.

Even though ChatGPT has subscriptions, making money on a platform that most people use for free is difficult—especially since it doesn’t currently run ads. It’s also unclear whether ad revenue would even be able to cover the scale of losses OpenAI is experiencing, and many users might stop using the platform entirely if ads were introduced.

Another potential option would be a forced subscription model instead of an optional one, such as requiring $10 a month to use ChatGPT at all. However, this would very likely drive many users away.

The opposite approach would be limiting what ChatGPT can do instead of limiting who can use it—such as preventing image generation or reducing the allowed word count in prompts. But again, this would almost certainly reduce usage and push people toward alternatives.

Right now, there doesn’t seem to be an easy solution. If OpenAI can’t figure something out, it could spell serious trouble for the company. And if OpenAI fails, products like ChatGPT and other tools they’ve built could disappear as well.

Some people have suggested a potential government bailout, but given the massive scale of the losses and the lack of political incentive, this seems unlikely. On top of all of this, OpenAI also faces a major lawsuit.

## :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4} Is Suing OpenAI for $134 Billion

More accurately, Elon Musk is suing the leadership of OpenAI. Musk played a major role in the creation of the company as a co-founder and donated millions of dollars to support OpenAI as a non-profit organization focused on developing safe, open-source AI.

Musk now argues that OpenAI went against that original vision. He claims he was deceived into believing the company would remain non-profit and open-source, and that OpenAI has since abandoned those principles.

If this lawsuit goes through and Musk wins, it could lead to massive shifts in the AI industry and further worsen OpenAI’s financial situation. It would also impact companies that rely on or are partnered with OpenAI.

## What’s Next for the Company?

The creators of ChatGPT have already stated that they are working on ways to stop the company’s revenue losses, but it’s still unclear whether these efforts will be enough—or whether they’ll drive users away instead.

This is not a problem with a clean or perfect solution. If ChatGPT were to go bankrupt, it would significantly slow the growth of the AI industry as a whole.

For now, all anyone can do is wait and see whether OpenAI can pull something together to keep itself afloat.
